- **Objectives**

Given:

1.  many streets.
2.  For each street, given coordinates of vertices consisting the street.

find:
corresponding undirected graph

1.  Vertices:
    \- intersections OR
    \- end-points of line segments that **intersect with other streets**
    (NOTE: vertex (2,-1) is not in the output)
2.  Edges
    \- at least one vertex is an intersection AND
    \- both vertices lie on the same street AND
    \- one vertex is reachable from the other vertex without traversing another vertex
    (NOTE: edge:(5,5)-(5,6) is not in the output)

Rules

1.  commands

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| a   | add a street |     |
| c   | change a street |     |
| r   | remove a street |     |
| g   | output graph as the result | 1\. form the "central data structure", get all segments of each street<br>\- input:{"StreeName": \[(2,1),(2,2),(5,5)\], "King":\[(4,3),(4,8)\]}<br>\- output:{"StreeName": \[((2,1),(2,2)),((2,2),(5,5))\], "King":\[((4,3),(4,8))\]}<br>2\. find the intersections between segments(format:**((2,2),(4,2))**:tuples in tuple)  of every two streets <br>2.1 put intersections into set V, and put another end-point of the segment contains the intersection into set V<br>2.2 put the segment in previous step (format:((2,2),(4,2)): two tuples in a tuple) in set E ) |

2.  use poly-line segment
3.  point out input errors. e.g "Error: 'c' or 'r' specified for a street that does not exist", and then continue to accept input.

- Python skills needed:
    - input parsing
    - use exceptions to catch errors

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| algorithm | \- find all intersections of every two roads<br>\- put intersections into set V, and put another end-point of the segment contains the intersection into set V<br>\- put the segment in previous step (format:((2,2),(4,2)): two tuples in a tuple) in set E ) |
| intermediate output | V={(2,2),(4,2),(4,4),(5,5)} : tuples in a set<br>E={((2,2),(4,2)),<br>((4,2),(2,2))}:tuples of tuples in a set |
| final output | V={(2,2),(4,2),(4,4),(5,5)} : tuples in a set<br>**E={((2,2),(4,2))}:deleted duplicated edge because it is undirected graph** |

- central data structure: {"StreeName": \[(2,1),(2,2),(5,5)\], "King":\[(4,3),(4,8)\]}

- Cartesian coordinate system: a coordinate system in which the coordinates of a point are its distances from a set of perpendicular lines that intersect at an origin, such as two lines in a plane or three in space.
