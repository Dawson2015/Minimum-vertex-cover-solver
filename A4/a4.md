## Objectives

- **Given**:
    1.  MiniSat Solver lib,

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Input | DIMACS CNF format (plain text):<br>  see Note below |
| Output |  SAT<br> 1 2 -3 4 5 0 <br>(Note: The 2nd line is the set of assignments to the boolean variables that satisfies the expression. the last term must be 0)<br> or<br> UNSAT<br>  |


Note:
DIMACS CNF format:

- line 1: 5 is the number_of_variables, 5 variables:1,2,3,4,5(variable can never be 0 because 0 is used as the end of a clause) ; 3 is the number_of_clauses, that is the number of lines after the 1st line;
- line 2 - 4: three clauses(each line ends with 0) as an expression:  
  (x1 | $\neg$x5 | x4) &
  ($\neg$x1 | x5 | x3 | x4) &
  ($\neg$x3 | $\neg$x4)
	- clause: a set of terms, connected with OR
	-  expression: a set of clauses, connected with AND 
 



2.  a undirected (unweighted) graph expressed as :
    V i : vertices 0, 1, ..., i-1
    E {&lt;2,6&gt;,&lt;2,8&gt;,&lt;2,5&gt;,&lt;6,5&gt;,&lt;5,8&gt;,&lt;6,10&gt;,&lt;10,8&gt;}

- Find: minimum vertex cover
- Rules:
***
- Q: what is the relationship between minimum vertex cover and **CNF-SAT**?
**SAT** (also called **Boolean satisfiability problem**, B-SAT, propositional satisfiability problem): whether the variables of a given Boolean formula can be consistently replaced by the value TRUE or FALSE in such a way that the formula evaluated to TRUE.
CNF-SAT: Conjunctive Normal Form:   (x1 | $\neg$x5 | x4) &  ($\neg$x1 | x5 | x3 | x4) & ($\neg$x3 | $\neg$x4)
