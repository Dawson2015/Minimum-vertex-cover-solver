## Objective

**Given**

1.  a undirected (unweighted) graph expressed as :
    V i : vertices 0, 1, ..., i-1
    E {&lt;2,6&gt;,&lt;2,8&gt;,&lt;2,5&gt;,&lt;6,5&gt;,&lt;5,8&gt;,&lt;6,10&gt;,&lt;10,8&gt;}
2.  s num1 num2 (e.g. s 2 8) (from a starting point to a destination)

**Find:**
the **shortest path** between num1 and num2 in the graph, as the format: num1- num3-num4-...-num2

**Rules:**
If the shortest paths exist, output only one of them. It they do not exist, "Error, shortest path does not exist."

## Algorithm:

### \- Breadth-first search for **unweighted** graph

- from the staring point, the path found by Breadth-first search to any node is the shortest path to that node.
